= Docker image for Neo4j on Apple Silicon

This image is a build of Neo4j's arm64 experimental image (runs on Apple M1 - silicon chip).

If using another architecture, you can open the `Dockerfile` in this repository and substitute the 3rd line (`FROM`) with the below code:

[source,text]
----
FROM neo4j:4.3.3
----

You will also need to change the 10th line in the `runNeo4j.sh` script to the following:

[source,shell]
----
neo4j:4.3
----

== Building and running the image

You can build the image on your local machine with the following command:

[source,shell]
----
docker build . -t <project>
----

*Note:* <project> in the above command is the repository you are referencing. If using the arm64 architecture, you can put `jmreif/neo4j-arm64`. If not on arm64 architecture, you can put `neo4j:4.3`.
